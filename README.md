  <h3 align="center">Dank Engine</h3>

  <p align="center">
    <b>Dank Engine</b> is a platform agnostic game engine written in C++ that seeks to provide game developers with a toolset to design and develop games using procedural generation at the forefront of the creative process. Dank Engine is currently in the very early stages of development.

## About Dank Engine
<p>Dank Engine is a work in progress and contains very limited implementation as of the time of reading this. The core philosophy is that each component of a game is a type of <i>Layer</i> (ie: Terrain_Data Layer, Biome Layer, Navigation Layer etc). Each Layer can communicate with any other layer in the system right out of the box. The obvious implentation of procedural generation applies to terrain heightmaps, terrain texturing, foliage maps, etc. Dank Engine opens up procedural generation to be used in area's that previously required hand built solutions.</p>
<p>In Dank Engine, rather than just generating content, your <b>systems</b> are procedurally generated. For example, you've imported your Snow Yeti model along with it's animations. A yeti should only roam the cold climate it's aclimated to, right? Attach an AI Navigation component and configure your conditions. These conditions could include the biome this yeti is allowed to enter, the layers they cannot enter (overly steep terrain, water, tree nodes, etc). This gives designers and developers an organic approach to building complex behaviour without the need of hand crafting systems from scratch.</p>
<p>Virtually any system can be built using this philosophy; Weather Systems, Post Processing FX, NPC spawn locations, NPC states, Quest locations, etc - all can be procedural generated by defining high level conditions to the various pre-existing Layer's of your game.</p>

### Built With

* [ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui)
* [Glad](https://glad.dav1d.de/)
* [spdlog](https://github.com/gabime/spdlog)

### Installation

<p>Currently Dank Engine is only tested on Windows 10 x64 with Visual Studio 2019.</p>

1. Clone the repo and submodules with recursive
   ```sh
   git clone --recursive https://github.com/masonentrican/dankengine
   ```
2. Generate the VS2019 project files
   ```sh
   GenerateProjectFiles.bat
   ```
3. Build assimp using cmake and copy the dll to the root folder (Temporary until build system is modified)
4. Build and Run in Visual Studio 2019
